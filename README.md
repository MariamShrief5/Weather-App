# Weather App 
A weather app project is a software application that displays real-time weather data and forecasts. It uses APIs to fetch data based on location, allowing users to view temperature, humidity, wind speed, and future weather predictions. The app often includes features like search, unit toggles (Celsius/Fahrenheit), and severe weather alerts, making it a useful tool for learning API integration, dynamic data handling, and UI design.

# Project Description:
The Weather App is a web-based application that provides users with real-time weather information and forecasts for any location. By integrating with a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap), the app retrieves and displays data including current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and daily or hourly forecasts. Users can search for different cities, view their current location's weather, and toggle between units (Celsius/Fahrenheit). The app also includes visual cues (icons or animations) to represent weather conditions like rain, snow, and sunny skies.
